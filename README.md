CasualKrypt
===========
Quick and Secure* File and On-The-Fly Cipher Program

**\*Note: This isn't actually secure. This was a pet project from way back in 2010 - 2012, before I had done any formal studies in Crypto. So it's actually pretty unsafe. Don't use it for anything serious. I mostly have this here for nostalgic reasons**

CasualKrypt is an 'ongoing' pet project that started back in 2010. Although it started on Python, the latest iteration is in C++ as both a commandline program or with a Qt GUI. At the time I started I didn't know anything about Cryptography and little did I know I would become involved so heavily in Crypto/CompSec. So it's nice to see the roots of what started off as a simple hobby and is now a career path.
